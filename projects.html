    <p class="jobInfo">
        This project involves the complete restoration of a 1991 Toyota MR2, a process that encompasses every aspect of the car’s rebuild, from the ground up. The goal of the project is to 
        restore the vehicle to its original condition, while improving performance, reliability, and aesthetics. The restoration process began with a thorough disassembly, 
        allowing me to inspect and rebuild the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. The bodywork was stripped down, with any rust or damage addressed and new paint 
        applied to bring the car’s exterior back to its (close) factory finish. This restoration project is not only a technical challenge but also a labor of passion, 
        combining skills in automotive, welding, electrical, and paintwork to breathe a new life into a this car.
