        My position at Portillo's was a pivotal point for me, marking my transition to a fast-paced, high-demand work environment. 
        While I had previous jobs, the experience at Portillo's truly tested my ability to thrive under pressure. The workflow was dynamic, 
        with each station dedicated to a specific food item, such as Beef, Broiler, Table, and Fries. I began at the Beef station but quickly became proficient in all areas, 
        allowing me to contribute across various stations. This versatility led to my role as a 'Floater,' where I provided support to the station in 
        greatest need or filled vacant positions. Mastering the different stations not only enhanced my skill set but also allowed me to directly assist my colleagues, 
        creating a collaborative and efficient team environment that I really enjoyed working in.
