        This website is a way for me to present myself in a different way. I have always enjoyed making websites and chose to make this one based 
        solely on my own motivation to do so. I also enjoy making designing a website because I feel like you need to consider a certain aspect of 
        human psychology to choose the most effective design for your audience. I scraped this site maybe 7 different times, I couldn't come up with 
        a way to present everything and I didn't like how it was turning out. When making this version of the site in specific I had one goal in mind, 
        simplistic presentation of myself for a career. {While I could be wrong I think there are times for overly complicated websites and there are times, 
        this being one of them, its almost better to take a more simplistic approach that can provide raw details and information. Maybe that's my {fondness} 
        of data and {liking} numbers that makes me think taking this approach is better, but here is what I produced.
