        This website serves as a unique platform for me to present myself in a different light. I have always had a passion for creating websites, and this project was driven entirely by my own 
        motivation to express my skills and showcase my journey. Designing a website goes beyond just aesthetic choices; I believe it requires an understanding of human psychology to select the 
        most effective layout and user experience for the intended audience. Throughout the development process, I started over multiple times—scrapping the site at least seven times—because I 
        couldn’t find the right balance of presentation and content. I wasn’t satisfied with how it was turning out and felt it wasn’t truly reflecting what I wanted to communicate.

        For this version, I set a specific goal: to create a clean, minimalist presentation of myself, focused on presenting the essential details for a career context. While I recognize there 
        are times when more complex, visually dynamic websites are appropriate, I felt that, in this case, a simpler, straightforward approach would best highlight the raw, 
        substantive information I wanted to share. Perhaps it's my affinity for data and my appreciation for numbers that makes me gravitate toward simplicity, but after much deliberation,
        I’m pleased with what I’ve produced here.
