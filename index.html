    <p>Hi! I’m Nicholas DeCook, a Data Engineering student at UIC based in Chicago. 
        This section of my website is dedicated to sharing more about who I am, my academic journey, 
        and the skills I bring to the table. From my passion for solving complex data challenges to my
         ongoing projects and personal interests, I hope to give you a better understanding of my background
          and what drives me. Whether you're here to explore my work or get to know me better, I’m excited to connect and share my story with you.

    <a href="skills.html" class = "infoTag">Skills</a>
    <p>These are skills that I have either learned through classes at school or being curious and teaching myself.
        This section will include example of those skills in action

    <p>Data is all about graphs and graphical analysis. Here is my attempt at doing that. Some key ways I
        use or make graphs are by using R and looking at statistical graphs or python with numpy and mathplotlib
        graphs. I have also learned how to use an SQL database and connect it to tablu and visualize the data on there.
    This section will have interactive graphs for you to see that.
